### **Objective**
The project focuses on **enhancing email spam detection** by comparing traditional **Machine Learning algorithms** (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) with **Deep Learning approaches** (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU). The aim is to build a **robust spam classification model** that can effectively **differentiate between spam and non-spam emails**.

### **Methodology**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Datasets were obtained from **Kaggle and other sources**.
   - Text preprocessing techniques like **tokenization, TF-IDF, and embeddings** were used.
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Three **Machine Learning** models: **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM**.
   - Three **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models**: **Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU**.
   - Three **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models** with different architectures.
3. **Performance Metrics**
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score** were used for model evaluation.
   - **Confusion matrices** were analyzed to understand false positives and false negatives.
4. **Best Model Selection**
